Project description:

Students are involved in different activities during a semester. Their work is generally scattered over so many different platforms and it is tedious to keep track of each platform. So, we came up with a platform Student Ally that enables students to manage their day-to-day tasks, as well as keep track of their academic progress.

Features:


My Tasks – A Task Manager

Students can add their daily tasks with descriptions and set reminders. Here in the to-do list, students can not only add their academic tasks but also any task belonging to their non-professional life. The moment student adds a task, an email invite will be sent to him/her prompting if he/she wants to add a reminder in their respective google account’s google calendar. If accepted the invite, Google Calendar will remind them about the task on the particular date. Once the task is accomplished or if for some reason the task no longer exists then students are easily provided with an option to delete it. So, students can be more efficient and productive with the help of our Student Ally task manager!

My courses -Course Manager

Students can keep track of their completed courses. This platform displays the required   credits in each of the course categories like GERs, core courses, major electives etc. viewing their current courses this semester and the current credits taken, it makes easier for them to decide which courses (of particular credit) to take in the upcoming semester. 
They can fill up a feedback form of the courses that they had taken previously right from the ‘Review Course’ functionality of the platform.

Course Catalog / filter courses-

Prior to any semester students are often indulged in researching different courses available at the university. They are curious to find out which courses are taught by their favorite professor or which courses can help them satisfy their requirement of course credits this semester. So here, a course catalog is designed with the help of which students can filter out courses based on the course category, course faculty and course credits.
